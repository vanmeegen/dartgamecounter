bugs:

1. Name list does not update after entering a second player name and pressing return, the first one updates. But its in the list since changing the name of the first will display the second then
2. Dragging names to sort shows correct drag animation but after dropping it pops back to original place. Looks like same update problem as in 1, since editing a name fixes the positions
